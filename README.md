# Currency Converter

This is a full e2e solution for a currency conversion module in Angular, Typescript and NodeJs.

# Prerequsites
Ensure you have node js and npm package installed. 

# Run
There are two ways to run this.
1. Use run.bat in a windows platform.
    This will start two terminals that will install dependencies and then run the program. 
    By default, the front end will launch on port 4200, and backend on 8040. These are just chosen arbirtraily. 
    For production they would run on 443 and behind a proxy. 

2. Manually running individual front end and backend folders separately. 
    Go into each directory, run npm install && npm start to run. 

See results by going to localhost:4200 in your browser
